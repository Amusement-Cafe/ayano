**Ayano** is a bot designed to manage [Amusement Club](https://github.com/Amusement-Cafe/amusementclub2.0) and is required for card management, voting webhooks, and remote management of the Amusement Club process.

## Setup
#### Directory Layout
Ayano requires AmusementClub2.0 to be downloaded as well and setup in a shared folder.
```
- Amusement Club
    - ayano
        - data
            - cards.json
            - collections.json
            - ...
        - config.json
        - index.js
        - ...
    - amusementclub2.0
        - index.js
        - ...
```
This layout is required so that Ayano can start and manage the Amusement Club process, and is also used for some file imports from amusement. So do not rename the `amusementclub2.0` folder or some commands may/will break!
#### Config
The ayano config is a mix of the development config included with Amusement Club and one specifically for ayano. If you are moving from development to an Ayano run instance there will be some changes needed for a successful transition.
